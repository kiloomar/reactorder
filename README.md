# A simple demo

This is a simple mini-demo of a react store.
You can authenticate to, order, manage your cart, and check order history.

# Live demo

Go here: [React order live](https://react-order-feb3f.web.app/).\
Login with joe@joe.com:joejoe or alice@alice.com:alice and give it a test run.\
It's working with firebase hosting limits, so if it's down, give it a day.
